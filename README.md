# xgit
A minimalistic, productivity driven git terminal interface

This repo is highly WIP and is basically an attempt to recreate the awesome [SublimeGit](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeGit)
I was really happy with how easy was to control git with just a few hot keys and so I wanted to recreate the experience in a terminal like app.
